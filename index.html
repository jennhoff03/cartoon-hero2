		<p>Sleeves are a great clue when it comes to dating your pictures.<br>
		At the end of the 1880s, sleeves started peeking up.  They became larger and larger throughout the 1890s until they were massive!<br>
		Here are some <b>real life</b> examples.</p>

<!-- Colors -->
		<h2>Colors in the clothing</h2>
		<p>Black and white pictures make it look like all their dresses were, well, black and white.  But they were very colorful!  The shirt in this 1892 dress looks white, but it was a lovely light pink eyelet.</p>
